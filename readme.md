Welcome to my GitHub! I'm an aspiring Software Engineer based in St. Gallen, Switzerland. At 19 years old, I have a strong passion for technology, and I spend my free time either coding, practicing judo, or hitting the slopes for some snowboarding. Alongside my hobbies, I'm deeply interested in computer science and economics. My favorite programming language is C#, and I'm always eager to learn more and take on new challenges.

Feel free to explore my projects here on GitHub. Iâ€™m always excited to connect with others who share my interests, so donâ€™t hesitate to reach out!

## My Skills and Experience

### [Object-Oriented Programming](/Object-Oriented_Pogramming/)
Throughout my education and internships, I've gained experience in object-oriented programming (OOP). My primary programming language is C#, which Iâ€™ve used extensively in both academic and personal projects. Additionally, Iâ€™ve had exposure to Java, which has broadened my understanding of OOP principles across different platforms.

### [Web Development](/Web_Development/)
I have hands-on experience in web development, particularly with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. One of my largest projects in this domain is my personal website, which showcases my ability to create functional and responsive web applications. 

### [Databases and Data Management](/Databases/)
In school, I gained experience working with both relational and NoSQL databases. Iâ€™ve worked with MySQL, SQLite, and MongoDB, gaining understanding of data management. During my internship, I also had the opportunity to work with Entity Framework, which allowed me to delve deeper into database interactions in C#.

### [Containerization and Cloud Technologies](/Containerization/)
I have practical experience with Docker and AWS, gained through various IT modules at the Informatikmittelschule. These technologies have allowed me to understand the importance of containerization and cloud services in modern software deployment.

### [Scripting and Automation](/Scripts_and_Tools/)
During my time at the Informatikmittelschule, I also worked with scripting languages like PowerShell and Bash. These tools have been invaluable in automating tasks, managing systems, and improving efficiency in various projects.
